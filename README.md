# Zombie-Dice-Game
A zombie dice game where you play against a computer.  

This assignment implements the decision theory principle of maximum expected utility in a game-playing context. The expected utility values are calculated, 
including how they are calculated in multi-agent environments. It requires you to design a heuristic evaluation function for a game, providing you with experience in the design of such functions.
